# PYTHON PRACTICE PROBLEM 6 (EASY, 15 POINTS)
# Problem Statement:-
# Generate a random integer from a to b. You and your friends have to guess a number between two numbers, a and
# b. a and b are inputs taken from the user. Your friend is player 1 and plays first. He will have to keep
# choosing the number, and your program must tell whether the number is greater than the actual number or less
# than the actual number. Log the number of trials it took your friend to arrive at the number. You play the
# same game, and then the person with the minimum number of trials wins! Randomly generate a number after taking
# a and b as input and donâ€™t show that to the user.
#
# Input:
# Enter the value of a
#
# 4
#
# Enter the value of b
#
# 13
#
# Output:
# Player1 :
#
# Please guess the number between 4 and 13
#
# 5
#
# Wrong guess a greater number again
#
# 8
#
# Wrong guess a smaller number again
#
# 6
#
# Correct, you took 3 trials to guess the number
#
# Player 2:
#
# Correct, you took 7 trials to guess the number
#
# Player 1 wins!
