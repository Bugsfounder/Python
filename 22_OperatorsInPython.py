# Arithmetic Operators
# Assignment Operators
# Comparison Operators
# Logical Operators
# Identity Operators
# Membership Operators
# Bitwise Operators

# ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
# print("5 + 6 is ", 5 + 6)  # + is a arithmetic operator
# print("5 - 6 is ", 5 - 6)  # - is a arithmetic operator
# print("5 * 6 is ", 5 * 6)  # * is a arithmetic operator
# print("5 ** 6 is ", 5 ** 6)  # * is a arithmetic operator
# print("5 / 6 is ", 5 / 6)  # / is a arithmetic operator
# print("5 // 6 is ", 5 // 6)  # // is a arithmetic operator
# print("5 % 6 is ", 5 % 6)  # % is a arithmetic operator

# ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
# print("ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS")
# x = 5  # = is a assignment operator
# print(x)
# x += 7  # += is a assignment operator
# print(x)
# x *= 7  # *= is a assignment operator
# print(x)
# x %= 7  # %= is a assignment operator
# print(x)
# x /= 7  # /= is a assignment operator
# print(x)
# x -= 7  # -= is a assignment operator
# print(x)
# x %= 7  # %= is a assignment operator
# print(x)

# COMPARISON OPERATORS
# i = 8
# print(i == 5)  # == is a comparison operator
# print(i == 8)
# print(i != 5)  # ! not operator is a comparison operator
# print(i > 5)  # > greater than operator is a comparison operator
# print(i < 5)  # < less than operator is a comparison operator
# print(i <= 5)  # <= less than equal to operator is a comparison operator
# print(i >= 5)  # >= greater than equal to operator is a comparison operator


# LOGICAL OPERATORS
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and a)
# print(a and b)
# print(a or b)

# IDENTITY OPERATORS
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a is b)
# print(a is not b)

# MEMBERSHIP OPERATORS
# lst = [32, 54, 12, 54, 23, 12, 17]
# print(23 in lst)
# print(23 not in lst)

# BITWISE OPERATOR
# 0 - 00
# 1 - 01
# 2 - 10
# 3 - 11

print(0 & 2)
print(0 | 3)
